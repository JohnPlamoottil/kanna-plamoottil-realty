# Project 3: Around the USA

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Descriptions**

This project is the first stage in a new project called Around the U.S.
In this iteration, I created a responsive layout from the design specs in Figma.

1. working with design specs
2. design in a world of ever-changing devices
3. grid layout
4. developing interfaces for different devices
5. intermediate Git

In Sprint4 I will utilize Javascript to make the project interactive

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes using media queries.

**Figma**

**Images**

- retrieved the images from the sprint3 platform
- or the images could be directly exported from Figma is another method
- optimized them so the projects load faster
